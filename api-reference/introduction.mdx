# Getting Started with Iroha 2 API

This guide will help you get started with the Iroha 2 blockchain platform using our API. Follow these steps to create your first account:

## 1. Generate a Key Pair

Before creating an account, you need to generate a cryptographic key pair. You have two options:

a) Use our API:
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/gen-key-pair`
   - This will return a public key and a private key

b) Use Iroha's official SDK:
   - Visit the [Iroha 2 Documentation](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-2-docs/guide/get-started/)
   - Follow their guide to generate a key pair programmatically

## 2. Create an Account

Once you have your key pair, you can create an account:

- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/accounts`
- Use the public key from step 1 in the request body

## 3. Request Test Tokens

Once you have an account, you can request test tokens:

- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/faucet`
- Use the account ID from step 2 in the request body
